# Performance Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

This document outlines the most critical performance issues identified in the repository. These issues have a high impact on the user experience and should be addressed as a priority.

## 1. Code Splitting

**Issue:** The application does not use code splitting. All components are loaded at once, which significantly increases the initial bundle size and, consequently, the loading time.

**Recommendation:** Implement code splitting for routes using `React.lazy` and `React.Suspense`. This will ensure that components are loaded on demand as the user navigates to different pages, reducing the initial load time and improving the time to interactive.

## 2. Video Optimization

**Issue:** The `PrimaryHero` component loads a 44.6MB video file (`src/components/assets/Untitled design.mp4`). This is a major performance bottleneck and will cause very long loading times, especially on slower connections.

**Recommendation:** Replace the video with a much smaller, optimized version. Use a video compression tool to reduce the file size and consider using a more efficient video format like WebM. The video should also be lazy-loaded to avoid blocking the initial page load.

## 3. Image Optimization

**Issue:** The images in the `public` directory are not optimized. Several images are over 200KB, which is too large for web use.

**Recommendation:** Compress and resize all images to appropriate dimensions. Use modern image formats like WebP, which offer better compression than JPEG and PNG. Also, ensure that all off-screen images are lazy-loaded using the native `loading="lazy"` attribute.
